# flow_ts_lib
Boilerplate for creating a lib with libdef and .d.ts without any manual labor
This is the basic for what I need
But this subject is very important and undocumented
The goal for this project is to help everybody that want to support ts and flow

# Help wanted
- Convert type definitions to flow libdef and vice versa, right now I used very basic regex flow to ts, without any validations. Babel plugin will be amazing.
- *Create how to do libdef for flow, right now I used flow gen-flow-files (still unstable)
- *Create how to do TypeScript type definitions

\* Definition for projects with types, for distribution with the artifacts.
Meaning when you are working with types you don't need to creates a separate definition file and maintain it manually, it should reflect your lib
